                <p class="text-project-page">This project aims to create a game that incentivizes children to move more
                    during the breaks between classes, while effectively utilizing the ever-shrinking areas of the
                    schoolyard. This is done through the asymmetrical game “Dodge City”. The game is a two-player
                    endless runner where one player controls the speed and direction of the character by running in
                    place. The second player interacts with a number of buttons at different heights and positions to
                    dodge obstacles. Through the game's unique interactions, it forces the players to both move and
                    communicate effectively to succeed in the game. In its final form, the game works as a proof of
                    concept of how one could utilize the digitization and gamification of the schoolyard to incentivize
                    movement and play.

                    The project was carried out with Generation Pep as one of the stakeholders.</p>

                <p class="text-project-page">
                    The ideation for this project started with the team brainstorming based on different themes that we
                    got from a presentation from Generation pep. The first theme was “teenage girls with a low
                    socio-economic status” as they were a critical group according to Generation Pep. This turned out to
                    be too difficult and we moved to a more open theme which was the shrinking schoolyards together with
                    the goal of combining software and hardware. That direction was more successful and resulted in the
                    group deciding to create a collaborative arcade game where the players need to move to control the
                    game.

                </p>

                <p class="text-project-page">
                    The next step was to decide what kind of game and how the controllers should be carried out. We
                    decided to go for a game with asymmetric abilities to make all players feel involved. It was also
                    decided to limit it to a two-player game. As the time was limited, we wanted to create a quite
                    simple game and this led us to an endless runner game as it contains a repetitive environment. This
                    caused one of the controllers to be a running pad.

                    The time limitation and the lack of material only lead to a few iterations. Here are some pictures

                        The final game is an endless runner type of game (but where the playtime is quite short) where
                        one player is controlling the speed and direction by running on step pads, and the other player
                        is dodging obstacles by pressing the right buttons at the correct time.

                        As this game is a collaborative game it is important to find a good balance between the players'
                        roles. One way this has been taken into consideration in the game is by giving the players
                        asymmetric abilities. Asymmetric abilities are a way of giving every player a feeling that they
                        are important and contribute to the result in their own unique way if it is implemented in a
                        good way. In this game, the asymmetric abilities are quite differentiated from each other and
                        the players need to cooperate and use their abilities to be able to reach success.

                        collaborative game where the players had to move but without it feeling forced.
